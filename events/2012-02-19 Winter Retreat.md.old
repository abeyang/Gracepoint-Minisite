We just had our second annual Winter Retreat! It was a wonderful opportunity for us to escape the daily grind and to hear many messages and to really grow closer to God.  It was all the more amazing, as several students committed their lives to God. 

We also had time to have some fun and get to know each other better.  The retreat site had so many things we could do: from human foosball, to rock climbing, to archery. Overall, this was an incredible experience and a time that we were able to reflect on how God has been actively pursuing each of us.
