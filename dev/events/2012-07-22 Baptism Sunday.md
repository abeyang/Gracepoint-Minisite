This is our third baptism Sunday celebrating the decisions of our brothers Hans, Tony, and Kevin. We were truly blessed to hear their testimonies and see the work God has been doing in each of their lives. It's so amazing that each of these brothers -- who came from such different backgrounds -- were able to see their brokenness and saw their need for a Savior.
