This past weekend, we were able to go up and visit our Gracepoint Berkeley church for the annual Thanksgiving Retreat!  We had a lot of fun meeting our brothers and sisters from our many sister churches -- from Davis, San Francisco, Austin, Minneapolis, San Diego, Hsinchu, and of course, Berkeley.  Through the sharing from many of our members, we saw how God had been concretely working through our other ministries. We were also able to get a glimpse into all the hard work that goes on to keep the church running; we were able to have a much greater appreciation for the sacrifice and hard work that people poured into the Church.  It truly was a retreat full of Thanksgiving.
