This past weekend, many of us went to Yosemite and stayed inside a cabin for a few days.  During the day, we hiked and enjoyed seeing the sights together; at night, we played games, had some great food, and each class had to do an embarrassing performance.  It was an awesome time to get away from Riverside and spend quality time together, as well as to reflect.
