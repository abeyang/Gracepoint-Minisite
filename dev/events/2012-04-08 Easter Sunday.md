We had a special Easter Service today. We kicked off with some of our upperclassmen brothers singing a special song. Afterwards, we got to hear a message on the true significance of Easter and were reminded of the importance of Jesus' resurrection.  We then fellowshipped over lunch, and even got to celebrate the birthdays of a few of the brothers and sisters.  Finally, we ended our time together with some sports and desserts.
